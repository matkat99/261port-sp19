Calculator steps
wait for a button to be clicked.
  check which button it was
  if it was a number
    check to see if we have a current operation.
      if yes...this should be the second number...store the number as number2
      if no...this is the first number...store it.
  if it was an operation
    store the operation
  if it was equal
    check to make sure we have a current number1, number2, and operation
      if yes...perform the operation, display the result, clear operation and number2
      if no...error.
We will need:
  a way to store number1, number2, operation
  an add function
  equal function
  function to handle a button click
  function to handle all of the other operations

TO DO
1. Nothing is working! If you click a button you get the following error. What does it mean? "TypeError: null is not an object (evaluating 'inputBox.value = parseFloat(button.innerHTML)')"  Fix this error.
2. Notice that around line 47 the clear function is called...but it hasn't been declared yet! Try adding 'add()' right below that then refresh your page...why can we call 'clear()' but not 'add()'? Hoisting.  function declarations are hoisted, function expressions are not...so they must be declared BEFORE they are used.  Move Add up above the buttonClicked function. This really only effects functions that are invoked immediately upon the javascript loading however. You will notice that your calculator works fine even though we got an error on 'add()'
3. It seems like the add method could be simplified by making it an arrow function. Make that change. Lets go ahead and move it above the equal function as well...just to make sure we don't run into any hoisting problems.
4. There is another problem with the calculator...I can only add single digit numbers currently...how can this be fixed? Fix it!
5. Add the code to make divide work.
6. This code works, but is a bit brittle. Everything is global and unrelated, in larger projects this could easily cause problems...we will talk more about how to solve this problem later.
